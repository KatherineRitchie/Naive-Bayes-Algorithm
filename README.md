# Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes Classifier 


This was the second C++ assignment we received in Software Design. Using preprocessed images of handwritten numbers and a simple Bayesian algorithm, this application can predict what digit an unknown hand-drawn number represent.
I found this project challenging because I had only been coding in C++ for a week when this was assigned. Upon reflection, I dislike my use of vectors to hold features, I think a multi-dimensional array would have been a cleaner solution. However, I think implementing the ‘using’ keyword to create a FeatureVector_t type was wise for streamlining the confusing multi-dimensional vectors.
